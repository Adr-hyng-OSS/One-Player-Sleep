# **One Player Sleep**
One Player Sleep is an addon that is widely used in Multiplayer in Minecraft. This addon, on the other hand, is useful to addon community users and creators since this is compatible with other addons. Moreover, it does not use any *"player.json"*. By just simple sleeping at night with the vanilla bed in multiplayer, it will turn to day after 3 seconds as default and is configurable depending on how many in-game seconds you like.
